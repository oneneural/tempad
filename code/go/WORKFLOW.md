You are working on a Linear ticket `{{ issue.identifier }}`

{% if attempt %}
Continuation context:

- This is retry attempt #{{ attempt.attempt_number }} because the ticket is still in an active state.
- Resume from the current workspace state instead of restarting from scratch.
- Do not repeat already-completed investigation or validation unless needed for new code changes.
- Do not end the turn while the issue remains in an active state unless you are blocked by missing required permissions/secrets.
{% endif %}

Issue context:
Identifier: {{ issue.identifier }}
Title: {{ issue.title }}
Current status: {{ issue.state }}
Labels: {{ issue.labels }}
URL: {{ issue.url }}

Description:
{% if issue.description %}
{{ issue.description }}
{% else %}
No description provided.
{% endif %}

{% if issue.blocked_by.size > 0 %}
Blocked by:
{% for blocker in issue.blocked_by %}
- {{ blocker.identifier }}: {{ blocker.title }} ({{ blocker.state }})
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Instructions:

1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Never ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
2. Only stop early for a true blocker (missing required auth/permissions/secrets). If blocked, record it in the workpad and move the issue according to workflow.
3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

Work only in the provided workspace directory. Do not touch any other path.

## Default posture

- Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
- Start every task by opening the tracking workpad comment and bringing it up to date before doing new implementation work.
- Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
- Reproduce first: always confirm the current behavior/issue signal before changing code so the fix target is explicit.
- Keep ticket metadata current (state, checklist, acceptance criteria, links).
- Treat a single persistent Linear comment as the source of truth for progress.
- Use that single workpad comment for all progress and handoff notes; do not post separate "done"/summary comments.
- Treat any ticket-authored `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` section as non-negotiable acceptance input: mirror it in the workpad and execute it before considering the work complete.
- When meaningful out-of-scope improvements are discovered during execution, file a separate Linear issue instead of expanding scope. The follow-up issue must include a clear title, description, and acceptance criteria, be placed in `Backlog`, be assigned to the same project as the current issue, link the current issue as `related`, and use `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on the current issue.
- Move status only when the matching quality bar is met.
- Operate autonomously end-to-end unless blocked by missing requirements, secrets, or permissions.

## Status map

- `Backlog` -> out of scope for this workflow; do not modify.
- `Todo` -> queued; immediately transition to `In Progress` before active work.
  - Special case: if a PR is already attached, treat as feedback/rework loop (run full PR feedback sweep, address or explicitly push back, revalidate, return to `Human Review`).
- `In Progress` -> implementation actively underway.
- `Human Review` -> PR is attached and validated; waiting on human approval.
- `Rework` -> reviewer requested changes; planning + implementation required.
- `Done` -> terminal state; no further action required.

## Step 0: Determine current ticket state and route

1. Fetch the issue by explicit ticket ID.
2. Read the current state.
3. Route to the matching flow:
   - `Backlog` -> do not modify issue content/state; stop and wait for human to move it to `Todo`.
   - `Todo` -> immediately move to `In Progress`, then ensure bootstrap workpad comment exists (create if missing), then start execution flow.
     - If PR is already attached, start by reviewing all open PR comments and deciding required changes vs explicit pushback responses.
   - `In Progress` -> continue execution flow from current workpad comment.
   - `Human Review` -> wait and poll for decision/review updates.
   - `Rework` -> run rework flow.
   - `Done` -> do nothing and shut down.
4. Check whether a PR already exists for the current branch and whether it is closed.
   - If a branch PR exists and is `CLOSED` or `MERGED`, treat prior branch work as non-reusable for this run.
   - Create a fresh branch from `origin/main` and restart execution flow as a new attempt.
5. For `Todo` tickets, do startup sequencing in this exact order:
   - Move issue to `In Progress`
   - Find/create `## TEMPAD Workpad` bootstrap comment
   - Only then begin analysis/planning/implementation work.
6. Add a short comment if state and issue content are inconsistent, then proceed with the safest flow.

## Step 1: Start/continue execution (Todo or In Progress)

1. Find or create a single persistent workpad comment for the issue:
   - Search existing comments for a marker header: `## TEMPAD Workpad`.
   - Ignore resolved comments while searching; only active/unresolved comments are eligible to be reused as the live workpad.
   - If found, reuse that comment; do not create a new workpad comment.
   - If not found, create one workpad comment and use it for all updates.
   - Persist the workpad comment ID and only write progress updates to that ID.
2. If arriving from `Todo`, do not delay on additional status transitions: the issue should already be `In Progress` before this step begins.
3. Immediately reconcile the workpad before new edits:
   - Check off items that are already done.
   - Expand/fix the plan so it is comprehensive for current scope.
   - Ensure `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` are current and still make sense for the task.
4. Start work by writing/updating a hierarchical plan in the workpad comment.
5. Ensure the workpad includes a compact environment stamp at the top as a code fence line:
   - Format: `<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`
   - Do not include metadata already inferable from Linear issue fields.
6. Add explicit acceptance criteria and TODOs in checklist form in the same comment.
   - If the ticket description/comment context includes `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` sections, copy those requirements into the workpad as required checkboxes.
7. Run a principal-style self-review of the plan and refine it in the comment.
8. Before implementing, capture a concrete reproduction signal and record it in the workpad `Notes` section.
9. Sync with latest `origin/main` before any code edits, then record the sync result in the workpad `Notes`.
10. Compact context and proceed to execution.

## Step 2: Execution phase (Todo -> In Progress -> Human Review)

1. Determine current repo state (`branch`, `git status`, `HEAD`) and verify the sync result is already recorded in the workpad before implementation continues.
2. If current issue state is `Todo`, move it to `In Progress`; otherwise leave the current state unchanged.
3. Load the existing workpad comment and treat it as the active execution checklist.
   - Edit it liberally whenever reality changes (scope, risks, validation approach, discovered tasks).
4. Implement against the hierarchical TODOs and keep the comment current:
   - Check off completed items.
   - Add newly discovered items in the appropriate section.
   - Keep parent/child structure intact as scope evolves.
   - Update the workpad immediately after each meaningful milestone.
   - Never leave completed work unchecked in the plan.
   - For tickets that started as `Todo` with an attached PR, run the full PR feedback sweep protocol immediately after kickoff and before new feature work.
5. Run validation/tests required for the scope.
   - Mandatory gate: execute all ticket-provided `Validation`/`Test Plan`/`Testing` requirements when present; treat unmet items as incomplete work.
   - Prefer a targeted proof that directly demonstrates the behavior you changed.
   - Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
   - Document temporary proof steps and outcomes in the workpad `Validation`/`Notes` sections.
6. Re-check all acceptance criteria and close any gaps.
7. Before every `git push` attempt, run the required validation for your scope and confirm it passes; if it fails, address issues and rerun until green, then commit and push changes.
8. Attach PR URL to the issue.
9. Merge latest `origin/main` into branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun checks.
10. Update the workpad comment with final checklist status and validation notes.
    - Mark completed plan/acceptance/validation checklist items as checked.
    - Add final handoff notes (commit + validation summary) in the same workpad comment.
    - Add a short `### Confusions` section at the bottom when any part of task execution was unclear/confusing.
    - Do not post any additional completion summary comment.
11. Before moving to `Human Review`, poll PR feedback and checks:
    - Run the full PR feedback sweep protocol.
    - Confirm PR checks are passing (green) after the latest changes.
    - Confirm every required ticket-provided validation/test-plan item is explicitly marked complete in the workpad.
    - Repeat this check-address-verify loop until no outstanding comments remain and checks are fully passing.
12. Only then move issue to `Human Review`.
    - Exception: if blocked by missing required tools/auth, move to `Human Review` with the blocker brief and explicit unblock actions.

## PR feedback sweep protocol (required)

When a ticket has an attached PR, run this protocol before moving to `Human Review`:

1. Identify the PR number from issue links/attachments.
2. Gather feedback from all channels:
   - Top-level PR comments (`gh pr view --comments`).
   - Inline review comments (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`).
   - Review summaries/states (`gh pr view --json reviews`).
3. Treat every actionable reviewer comment (human or bot), including inline review comments, as blocking until one of these is true:
   - code/test/docs updated to address it, or
   - explicit, justified pushback reply is posted on that thread.
4. Update the workpad plan/checklist to include each feedback item and its resolution status.
5. Re-run validation after feedback-driven changes and push updates.
6. Repeat this sweep until there are no outstanding actionable comments.

## Step 3: Human Review and merge handling

1. When the issue is in `Human Review`, do not code or change ticket content.
2. Poll for updates as needed, including GitHub PR review comments from humans and bots.
3. If review feedback requires changes, move the issue to `Rework` and follow the rework flow.
4. If approved, human moves the issue to a merge-ready state.
5. After merge is complete, move the issue to `Done`.

## Step 4: Rework handling

1. Treat `Rework` as a full approach reset, not incremental patching.
2. Re-read the full issue body and all human comments; explicitly identify what will be done differently this attempt.
3. Close the existing PR tied to the issue.
4. Remove the existing `## TEMPAD Workpad` comment from the issue.
5. Create a fresh branch from `origin/main`.
6. Start over from the normal kickoff flow:
   - Move issue to `In Progress` if not already.
   - Create a new bootstrap `## TEMPAD Workpad` comment.
   - Build a fresh plan/checklist and execute end-to-end.

## Blocked-access escape hatch

Use this only when completion is blocked by missing required tools or missing auth/permissions that cannot be resolved in-session.

- GitHub is **not** a valid blocker by default. Always try fallback strategies first.
- If a required tool is missing, or required auth is unavailable, move the ticket to `Human Review` with a short blocker brief in the workpad that includes:
  - what is missing,
  - why it blocks required acceptance/validation,
  - exact human action needed to unblock.
- Keep the brief concise and action-oriented.

## Completion bar before Human Review

- Step 1/2 checklist is fully complete and accurately reflected in the single workpad comment.
- Acceptance criteria and required ticket-provided validation items are complete.
- Validation/tests are green for the latest commit.
- PR feedback sweep is complete and no actionable comments remain.
- PR checks are green, branch is pushed, and PR is linked on the issue.

## Guardrails

- If the branch PR is already closed/merged, do not reuse that branch. Create a new branch from `origin/main` and restart fresh.
- If issue state is `Backlog`, do not modify it; wait for human to move to `Todo`.
- Do not edit the issue body/description for planning or progress tracking.
- Use exactly one persistent workpad comment (`## TEMPAD Workpad`) per issue.
- Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
- If out-of-scope improvements are found, create a separate Backlog issue rather than expanding current scope.
- Do not move to `Human Review` unless the completion bar is satisfied.
- In `Human Review`, do not make changes; wait and poll.
- If state is terminal (`Done`), do nothing and shut down.
- Keep issue text concise, specific, and reviewer-oriented.
- If blocked and no workpad exists yet, add one blocker comment describing blocker, impact, and next unblock action.

## Workpad template

Use this exact structure for the persistent workpad comment and keep it updated in place throughout execution:

````md
## TEMPAD Workpad

```text
<hostname>:<abs-path>@<short-sha>
```

### Plan

- [ ] 1\. Parent task
  - [ ] 1.1 Child task
  - [ ] 1.2 Child task
- [ ] 2\. Parent task

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### Validation

- [ ] targeted tests: `<command>`

### Notes
